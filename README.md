# WorldSeriesSearch

## Introduction
This quick program uses lists to search for a specific winning team based on the year a user inputs and then calculate the number of times this particular team won. 

## Things to work on
1. Create a way to scrape a specific webpage for the winners of the World Series rather than using a static .txt file
2. Create a GUI for the program rather than having it run out of the Python console
